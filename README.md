### Installation

#### Setup Backend (Flask API)

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your SportsData API key:

    ```env
    API_KEY=your_sportsdata_api_key
    SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key
    ```

5. **Run the Flask Server:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The server should be running at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

#### Setup Frontend (React App)

1. **Open a new terminal window/tab.**

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Build the React App:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will generate a `build` folder with the production-ready files.
